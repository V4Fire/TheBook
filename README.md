# V4Fire The Book

V4Fire is a heavily opinionated meta-framework. It follows OOP paradigm to create components. Components are styled using the [`stylus`](https://stylus-lang.com/) language and
[BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/).

We strongly believe in separation of concerns: ui, logic and styles of the component are stored
in separate files. To describe the ui of the component
[`snakeskin`](http://snakeskintpl.github.io/docs/index.html) language is used.
It allows to extend and override parts of the component's ui using inheritance mechanism.
